# Topola â€“ online genealogy visualization

Topola is a Typescript/Javascript library for embedding genealogy tree visualizations on web pags. The library uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) under the hood for rendering SVG images.

Implemented chart types:
* Ancestors
* Descendants
* Hourglass chart (both ancestors and descendants)

Have a look at the [demo page](https://pewu.github.io/topola/) to see the current visualization possibilities.
