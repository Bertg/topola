# Topola â€“ online genealogy visualization

Topola is a Typescript/Javascript library for embedding genealogy tree visualizations on web pags. The library uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) under the hood for rendering SVG images.

Currently, only simple ancestor and descendant charts are implemented.

Have a look at the [demo page](https://pewu.github.io/topola/) to see the current visualization possibilities.

## Running
