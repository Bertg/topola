# Topola â€“ online genealogy visualization

Topola is a Typescript/Javascript library for embedding genealogy tree visualizations on web pags. The library uses [D3](https://d3js.org/) under the hood for rendering SVG images.

Currently, only a simple ancestor graph is implemented.

Have a look at the demo page *[TODO]* to see the current visualization possibilities.

## Running
To run the demo, run these commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```

# Future

The aim of this project is to create a feature-rich library for creating interactive genealogy visualizations for the Web.
